    What materials and manufacturing processes are in use?

        Natural Materials -- stone, wood, bone, antler, horn, plant & animal fibers, leather, cold worked native metals

        Heated Materials -- pottery, glass, faience, metals from ores/hot worked

        Synthetic materials, chemical origin -- e.g. plastics through chemical reactions

        Synthetic materials, atomic -- e.g. materials created through nanotechnology, matter compilers, molecular assembly, etc

        Magical materials -- materials created or modified with magic, or inherently magical

    Energy Sources (Heat & Light)

        Burnables -- direct use

        Burnables -- electricity generation

        Atomic energy -- fission and/or fusion for direct heat/light or electricity

    Information Flow

        Pre-Literate -- all communication in person oral/auditory or visual/sign/body language

        Literate -- handwritten only and/or rare, long distances have time delays

        Literate -- printing technology and/or common, long distances still have time delays

        Long Distance, Rapid -- e.g. radio, telegraph, telephone, simple information only

        Long Distance, Complex and Rapid -- rapid or instantaneous communication of complex information (e.g. computer files)

        Magic

    Technology Paradime

        Stable -- no real changes

        incremental progress -- slow, steady progress through small changes

        Paradigm change occurring -- rapid shift in technology

        Regressing/technology loss -- technological and/or scientific knowledge being lost or falling out of use

        Clashing -- users of two+ technology systems encounter each other

        Rural

        Suburban

        Low Density Urban

        High Density Urban

    Social Complexity

        Bands -- small, egalitarian, little formal leadership

        Tribes -- more organized than bands, still relatively little use of ascribed status

        Chieftainships -- at least two social classes based on ascribed status

        States -- formal government, lots of options here

        Empire -- one country controls other countries

        Disorganized

    Area Controled

        Local

        Regional

        Continent

        Multi-System

    Military -- Weapons

        Sharp edges and blunt force, muscle powered

        Sharp edges and blunt force, mechanically powered or assisted (e.g. bows, catapults)

        Gunpowder and other chemicals

        Atomic and Orbital strikes

        Magic

    Military -- Force composition (ACOUP discussion of difference between soldiers and warriors)

        warriors -- fighting skills integral to identity and status

        professional soldiers (state employ)

        mercenaries

        part-time militia

        irregulars

    Military -- Fighting Style (ACOUP reference)

        Raiding/Asymmetrical/First System

        Siege/Pitched Battle/Second System

        Modern/Third System (territorial control, cover & concealment)





    Trade & Resource Acquisition -- Scale

        Local

        Regional

        Long Distance, Indirect -- e.g. A trades w/ B, B trades w/ C, C trades w/ D, so A has access to trade goods from D, but no contact with D

        Long Distance, Direct

    Resource Acquisition & Distribution Methods

        private trade & commerce

        taxes, tribute, government spending

        redistributive and communal

        theft, raiding, piracy

        gift/favor economy

    Economic Base

        Foraging

        Fishing

        Pastoral

        Agriculture/Horticulture

        Industrial

        Service

    Settlement Pattern

        nomadic -- foraging, pastoral, or peripatetic

        semi-nomadic

        sedentary

    Historic Depth

        Present Day, Short (<10 years)

        Present Day, Long (<100 years)

        multiple discontinuous time periods

        continuous history, 100+ years

        continuous history, 1,000+ years (for comparison, written human history is about 5,000 years)
