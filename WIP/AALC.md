Appearance

- What the magic looks like ?
  - Makes the world feel more exotic
  - Can cause problems for
characters but cannot solve them
  - Usually tied to a character arc

Abilities

* What the magic does ?
  - Points calculated based on
magical effect, range, number of
people affected, and duration
  - Characters have a finite amount of
fuel (mana) to use abilities
  - More powerful abilities require
more fuel
  - The fuel does not have to be overt
for the audience to understand
  - If points not overt, cannot solve
conflicts unless a cost system is
added


Limits

* Unlimited uses of magical abilities
* Abilities stratified in codified
levels defined by their limits
* The more the levels' abilities and
limits are known by the audience,
the more they can be used to solve
conflicts
* Focused on clever uses of abilities
against stronger foes
* Cost system can be added to
enhance dramatic moments


Cost

* Costs must be greater than or
equal to abilities to make them
dramatically satisfying
* Costs can include time,
exhaustion, materials, sanity,
morality, etc.
* Adds dilemma to magic by
forcing characters to make
choices
* The greater the character's
sacrifice, the more audience
satisfaction at conflict resolution
