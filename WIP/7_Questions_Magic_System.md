1. What personal qualities does magic reward? What, specifically, makes one person better at magic than the next?

2. How does it feel to use magic? What's going through a magician's head as they do their thing? What does it feel like to be unsuccessful at magic?

3. How have people in-universe misinterpreted the way magic works? Give us their worst takes, the magical equivalent of flat-earth theories.

4. What is magic utterly incapable of achieving? Full stop, no exceptions.

        Note: it doesn't have to be an absolute limitation, like "magic can't raise the dead" or "magic can't create matter". Feel free to make qualified limitations, e.g. "magic can't undo somebody else's magic" or "magic can't be used without preparing spells ahead of time".

5. What can magic serve as a metaphor for? Magic is like cooking, magic is like telling a good lie, magic is like surgery, magic is like learning to whistle. Go nuts with it, the more niche the better.

6. Consider an average denizen in your setting. What's the most impressive act of magic they've witnessed? The most impressive act of magic they've heard about? The most impressive act they can imagine?

7. How can you recognize a magician? Do magicians want to be recognized? How do they advertise or downplay their magical aptitude?
